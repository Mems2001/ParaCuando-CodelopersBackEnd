<h1>Basic Information for team work</h1>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h2>About npm & node versions:</h2>
        <p>This "Skeleton" was created using npm v9.2.0 & node v18.13.0.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Update your own npm & node is necesary for better work flow, so, before cloning, merging or fetching the repository, make sure you already have updated npm & node</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>About dependencies:</h2>
            <p>Make sure to install dependencies before working, this is simply done by running the comand "npm install"</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>About syntax conventions:</h2>
            <p>Make sure you have read at least the first part of the <a href='https://academlo.notion.site/Base-del-Proyecto-b54473bef71747369accb2c569b94ce6'>Project Bases</a> document, wich specify notation requirements for naming and object properties calling.</p>
            </br>
            <p>Also, remember to always use git commit conventions as follows:</p>
            <h6>Prefixes:</h6>
            <ul>   
                <li>feat: adding a new feature</li>
                <li>fix: bug and error fixing</li>
                <li>docs: documentation related</li>
                <li>perf: performance improvement changes</li>
                <li>refactor: changes that doesn't improve the performance, but report some other kind of improvement(for example, on order or legibility)</li>
                <li>test: code for testing purposes</li>
            </ul>
            </br>
            <p>After the prefix we have to give a simple but precise description of our contribution, followed by our name or nickname in parenthesis (I think this will help us to notice whether our partners are contribuing or not, and to quikly identify whom to contact in case of need).</p>
            </br>
            <h6>Example:</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>git commit -m 'feat: users model added (Mario)'</li>
            </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
